# A common strategy for reducing sequencing costs when sequencing multiple samples
# is to use a specific 3’ adapter sequence (barcode) per sample, mix all sample libraries
# and run a single sequencing reaction, and then use the sample-specific adapter
# sequence (barcode) to identify (de-multiplex) which sample any given sequence
# belongs to. The file Multiplexed.gz contains the results of such a multiplex
# sequencing experiment. Your tasks are (1) to identify the barcodes (3’ adapters) used
# and thereby how many samples were multiplexed, (2) identify how many sequences
# that were sequenced from each sample, and (3) identify the sequence length
# distribution within each sample. What is the most frequently occurring sequence
# within each sample?

# Task 1
# TODO Identify 3' adapter barcodes
# TODO How many samples were multiplexed?

# Task 2
# TODO How many seaquences for each barcode?

# Task 3
# TODO Sequence length distribution in each barcode sample
# TODO What is the most frequently occuring sequence within each sample?
